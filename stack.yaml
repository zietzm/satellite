# A 'specific' Stackage snapshot or a compiler version.
# A snapshot resolver dictates the compiler version and the set of packages
# to be used for project dependencies. For example:
#

compiler: ghc-9.6.6
snapshot: lts-22.43

# snapshot: lts-23.14
# snapshot: nightly-2024-12-13
# snapshot: ghc-9.8.2
#
# The location of a snapshot can be provided as a file or url. Stack assumes
# a snapshot provided as a file might change, whereas a url resource does not.
#
# snapshot: ./custom-snapshot.yaml
# snapshot: https://example.com/snapshots/2024-01-01.yaml
# snapshot:
#   url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commercialhaskell/stackage-snapshots/master/lts/23/14.yaml

# User packages to be built.
# Various formats can be used as shown in the example below.
#
# packages:
# - some-directory
# - https://example.com/foo/bar/baz-0.0.2.tar.gz
#   subdirs:
#   - auto-update
#   - wai
packages:
- .
# Dependency packages to be pulled from upstream that are not in the snapshot.
# These entries can reference officially published versions as well as
# forks / in-progress versions pinned to a git hash. For example:
#
extra-deps:
  - vector-fft-0.2.0.0@sha256:c5b9d0543a3a97434079f6e4f2af2feaf188a00421ea8621b295d30eeedd5ee8,1786
  - vector-fftw-0.1.4.1

# Override default flag values for project packages and extra-deps
# flags: {}

# Extra package databases containing global packages
# extra-package-dbs: []

nix:
  enable: true
  packages: [fftw, fftwFloat]

# Control whether we use the GHC we find on the path
# system-ghc: true
#
# Require a specific version of Stack, using version ranges
# require-stack-version: -any # Default
# require-stack-version: ">=3.3"
#
# Override the architecture used by Stack, especially useful on Windows
# arch: i386
# arch: x86_64
#
# Extra directories used by Stack for building
# extra-include-dirs: [/path/to/dir]
# extra-lib-dirs: [/path/to/dir]
#
# Allow a newer minor version of GHC than the snapshot specifies
# compiler-check: newer-minor
